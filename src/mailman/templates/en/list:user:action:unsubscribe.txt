Mailing list removal confirmation notice for mailing list $listname

We have received a request for the removal of your email address, "${email}"
from the $listaddr mailing list.  To confirm that you want to be removed from
this mailing list, simply reply to this message, keeping the Subject header
intact.

Or include the following line -- and only the following line -- in a
message to $requestaddr:

    confirm $cookie

Note that simply sending a reply to this message should work from most mail
readers, since that usually leaves the Subject line in the right form
(additional "Re:" text in the Subject is okay).

If you do not wish to be removed from this list, please simply disregard this
message.  If you think you are being maliciously removed from the list, or
have any other questions, send them to $listadmin
